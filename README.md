This is a simple script for calculating Bayesian Generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram with linear Trend. The regression model includes a harmonic component, offset and linear trend with Gaussian independent noise.
The detailed model specification can be found from the <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017arXiv171208235O">paper</a>.
